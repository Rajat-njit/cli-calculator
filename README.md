## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **Basic operations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- **Modular design**: separated into `calculation`, `calculator`, and `operation` packages  
- **Interactive REPL (Readâ€“Evalâ€“Print Loop)**: type expressions to calculate directly in the terminal  
- **Error handling**: safe division and input validation  
- **Testing**: `pytest` with 90%+ coverage enforced in CI  
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions run tests automatically on every push or PR to `main`
